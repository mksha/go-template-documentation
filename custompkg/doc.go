	Printing

	Other flags:
		+	always print a sign for numeric values;
			guarantee ASCII-only output for %q (%+q)
		-	pad with spaces on the right rather than the left (left-justify the field)
		#	alternate format: add leading 0b for binary (%#b), 0 for octal (%#o),
			0x or 0X for hex (%#x or %#X); suppress 0x for %p (%#p);
			for %q, print a raw (backquoted) string if strconv.CanBackquote
			returns true;
			always print a decimal point for %e, %E, %f, %F, %g and %G;
			do not remove trailing zeros for %g and %G;
			write e.g. U+0078 'x' if the character is printable for %U (%#U).
		' '	(space) leave a space for elided sign in numbers (% d);
			put spaces between bytes printing strings or slices in hex (% x, % X)
		0	pad with leading zeros rather than spaces;
			for numbers, this moves the padding after the sign


	For example,
		fmt.Sprintf("%[2]d %[1]d\n", 11, 22)
	will yield "22 11", while
		fmt.Sprintf("%[3]*.[2]*[1]f", 12.0, 2, 6)
	equivalent to
		fmt.Sprintf("%6.2f", 12.0)
	will yield " 12.00". Because an explicit index affects subsequent verbs,
	this notation can be used to print the same values multiple times
	by resetting the index for the first argument to be repeated:
		fmt.Sprintf("%d %d %#[1]x %#x", 16, 17)
	will yield "16 17 0x10 0x11".
